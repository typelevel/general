The ultimate goal for this program is to provide ways for the user community to ensure 
the long-term sustainability of the development and maintenance of some Typelevel libraries.

Based on the [Cats ecosystem community survey 2018 results](https://typelevel.org/blog/2019/01/30/cats-ecosystem-community-survey-results.html), as well as feedback from potential donors, we adopted the following principles for the program:

### Principles:

* Paid maintainers focus on supporting the community contributors. In another sentence, 
paid maintainers’ first task is to maintain the community-driven development. 
More detailed responsibilities are listed below.
* Main obligations to sponsors (individual or corporate) are limited to  
  - The existing license remains unchanged. 
  - Timely security patches and mission critical bug fixes. 
  - Financial contributions will NOT grant contributors extra influence over the development.
  - Financial contributors can influence how their contribution is distributed among projects. 
* The program is governed by an independent committee. 
* As part of our community, sponsors hold values compatible with the [Scala Code of Conduct](https://www.scala-lang.org/conduct/).

## Responsibilities for paid maintainers 
Based on these principles, we established the following three main goals and relevant tasks for paid maintainers. 

### Goal 1: Provide guidance for community contributors

Relevant tasks:  

* Create/maintain contribution guidance documentation
* Review PRs in a timely fashion
* Create friendly issues for first-time contributors
* Provide real-time tech support for contribution related topics

### Goal 2: Relieve community contributors from most fastidious, ingrate tasks

Relevant tasks:  

* Maintain/improve infrastructure, e.g. build, tests, linting etc. 
* Plan and manage releases
* Backports to support of old Scala version
* Create documentation

### Goal 3: Ensure the ecosystem is unblocked

Relevant Tasks: 

* Fix mission-critical bug 
* Address security vulnerabilities
* Enforce compatibility guarantees
* Take on initiatives that require a significant amount of effort usually too large for casual contributors to 
take on, e.g. complete Scala 2.13 migration; merging in typelevel/algebra; integration with Scala 3.0 std library, etc.

## Funding source

We'll be relying on donations from corporation and individual users of the OSS libraries. Aside from monetary assistance, companies can support us by:

* Providing computing resources/tools such as CI systems, communication platforms, development tools, etc.
* Paid employees' time for code contributions
* Sponsor events such as free training, conferences, by providing the venue, food, etc.
* Donation of training/support services or coupons that we can then exchange for monetary contributions.  

Perks for sponsoring companies include

* Branding on our sponsors' list (at $200 per month or 100 paid employee hours per year)
* Job posts (at $500/month level)
* Training / Technical support (if we receive such donations)

We reserve the right to respectfully decline sponsorship offers. 


## Typelevel libraries in the program


1. Cats and its external modules projects including
   * cats-effect
   * cats-mtl
   * mouse
   * kittens
   * cats-tagless
   * Cats-collections
2. Shapeless
3. Spire

We are in the process of enlisting more Typelevel libraries into the program based on their maintainers’ as well as sponsors’ interests.
